# Awesome Dutch Learning
A list of resources for learning Dutch as a foreign language.

## Apps

### Flashcards

#### AlgoApp 
[AlgoApp a.k.a. AnkiApp](https://www.ankiapp.com/)
A free app for mobile. It's free for 100 flashcards per day which is usually enough.

#### Anki
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
[AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/about)
The OG of flashcards, they provide a mobile app, but it is paid. The app is free on web.

### Tutoring/conversation/guided learning

#### iTalki
[iTalki](https://www.italki.com)
A great platform for connecting with tutors and conversation partners. The platform itself is free, but the tutors and partners all have their own hourly rate. Compared to in-person alternatives, it is almost always a very good rate.
  
#### Duolingo
[Duolingo](https://duolingo.com)
The one, the only Duolingo. It is a great way to get started, but the learning is quite slow and unfocused. It is great to gain an all-around education and get to the A1-A2 level. It does not give confidence in listening and speaking.
